So… I finally made my own website.

It's been one of those things I've wanted to do for a while — not just to check a box as a developer, but more as a personal challenge. I wanted something I could point to and say, "Hey, I built this." Not a template. Not a clone. Just mine, from scratch.

## The Motivation

Yes, part of the reason is professional — having a portfolio is definitely a plus when you're applying for jobs or working on side projects. But beyond that, I wanted to create a space that's completely mine. Somewhere to showcase my work, write about whatever I feel like, and slowly build a digital footprint on my own terms.

No algorithms, no platforms — just a site that reflects what I do and what I enjoy.

## What's on Here

The site is split into a few parts:

- A portfolio section with the projects I've built
- A blog (you're reading it) where I'll post about coding, gaming, reading — whatever catches my interest
- And just the general vibe of "here's a corner of the internet that I control"

I'm not promising frequent blog updates, but whenever I have something worth writing — or rambling — about, it'll probably show up here.

## The Tech Stack

For those curious about how this thing was built:

- **Framework**: Next.js 15+ and React 19+
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4, with components styled using ShadCN
- **Content**: Posts and pages written in MDX
- **Emails**: Handled by Resend

I'm proud of how everything came together. There's nothing flashy or overengineered here — just a clean, functional site that does what I want it to do.

## What's Next

The design will probably stay the same for a while (I'm not exactly a visual designer), but I'll keep it updated with new projects and blog posts as they happen.

That's all for now. If you stumbled across this post somehow, thanks for reading. And if you're here to check out my work — welcome!
