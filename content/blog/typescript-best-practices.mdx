# TypeScript Best Practices for 2024

TypeScript has evolved significantly over the years, and with it, the best practices for writing type-safe code have also matured. Let's explore some essential patterns and practices.

## Type Inference vs Explicit Types

One of the most common questions in TypeScript is when to use type inference and when to explicitly declare types. Here's a general guideline:

```typescript
// Let TypeScript infer simple types
const count = 0 // inferred as number
const message = 'Hello' // inferred as string

// Explicitly type complex objects and function parameters
interface User {
  id: string
  name: string
  preferences: {
    theme: 'light' | 'dark'
    notifications: boolean
  }
}

function updateUser(user: User, updates: Partial<User>) {
  return { ...user, ...updates }
}
```

## The Power of Generics

Generics are one of TypeScript's most powerful features. They allow you to write flexible, reusable code while maintaining type safety:

```typescript
function getFirstItem<T>(array: T[]): T | undefined {
  return array[0]
}

// TypeScript knows the exact return types
const firstNumber = getFirstItem([1, 2, 3]) // number | undefined
const firstString = getFirstItem(['a', 'b', 'c']) // string | undefined
```
