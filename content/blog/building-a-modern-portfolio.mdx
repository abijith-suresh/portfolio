# Building a Modern Portfolio with Next.js

Creating a portfolio website is one of the best ways to showcase your work and skills as a developer. In this post, I'll share my experience building this portfolio using modern web technologies.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js has become my go-to framework for building web applications. Here's why:

- **Performance**: Built-in optimizations for images, fonts, and static assets
- **Developer Experience**: Great TypeScript support and intuitive file-based routing
- **Flexibility**: Choose between static generation and server-side rendering
- **Scalability**: Easy to start small and grow as needed

## Key Features

Some of the key features I implemented in this portfolio:

1. **Dark Mode Support**: Using next-themes for seamless theme switching
2. **MDX Blog Posts**: Writing content in Markdown with JSX components
3. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
4. **Image Optimization**: Leveraging Next.js Image component
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout the project

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of how I implemented the theme toggle:

```tsx
import { useTheme } from 'next-themes'

export function ThemeToggle() {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme()

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setTheme(theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark')}>
      Toggle Theme
    </button>
  )
}
```

## What's Next?

I'm planning to add more features to this portfolio:

- Analytics integration
- Interactive project demos
- Improved accessibility
- Performance optimizations

Stay tuned for more updates!
