# Changelog

All notable changes to this site are documented in this file.

This changelog follows the categories and intent of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), but tracks the site as a series of dated milestones instead of package releases.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Featured Projects section to the landing page, pulling project cards from the projects collection.

### Changed

- Rewrote the hero greeting to a conversational first-person voice ("Hey, I'm Abijith"), shortened the intro to two focused sentences with a line break, and changed the tagline from "Software Developer" to "Backend Engineer".
- Widened the hero clay rule from `w-12` to `w-20` so it reads as a confident compositional element rather than a tick mark.
- Adjusted hero spacing to `pt-24 md:pt-32` for generous but not excessive breathing room; tightened content sections to `py-8` for a focused rhythm.
- Replaced the "Latest Posts" heading with the uppercase tracked label treatment ("RECENT WRITING"), matching the about page's section markers and letting card titles stay the visual focus.
- Made content card hover arrows visible at ~40% opacity at rest, transitioning to clay color on hover for better clickability affordance.
- Entrance animations now play only on the first page load per session; subsequent navigations skip the staggered reveal for a snappier experience.
- Replaced clay accent with deep evergreen (OKLCH hue 155, chroma 0.09) for a more grounded, confident identity that works in both light and dark themes.
- Removed card borders entirely; cards now use tonal surface steps (card → popover) for visual separation.
- Replaced card translate-y hover with subtle scale(1.01) and tonal background wash for a smoother, more organic feel.
- Updated DESIGN.md to document the new green accent and simplified card hover behavior.
- Restored card borders as a static 1px element that does not participate in hover state.
- Replaced card hover easing from generic `ease-out` to ease-out-quint (`cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)`) with 250ms duration for a smoother settle into place.
- Increased card hover scale from 1.01 to 1.015 for perceptible but subtle movement.
- Reduced dark theme surface chroma from 0.016–0.020 to 0.006–0.010 (near-neutral with warm bias) to eliminate the reddish-brown cast and let the green accent dominate the canvas.
